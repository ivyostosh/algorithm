# sorted() Parameters
sorted() can take a maximum of three parameters:

iterable - A sequence (string, tuple, list) or collection (set, dictionary, frozen set) or any other iterator.
reverse (Optional) - If True, the sorted list is reversed (or sorted in descending order). Defaults to False if not provided.
key (Optional) - A function that serves as a key for the sort comparison. Defaults to None.

We can also use [::,-1] to achieve the same reversal function.
