Time Complexity in Coding Interview
• O(1) 极少
• O(logn) 几乎都是二分法
• O(√n) 几乎是分解质因数
• O(n) 高频
• O(nlogn) 一般都可能要排序
• O(n2) 数组，枚举，动态规划
• O(n3) 数组，枚举，动态规划
• O(2^n) 与组合有关的搜索 combination
• O(n!) 与排列有关的搜索 permutation



# https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-recursion-and-iteration/

Property	Recursion	Iteration
Definition	Function calls itself.	A set of instructions repeatedly executed.
Application	For functions.	For loops.
Termination	Through base case, where there will be no function call.	When the termination condition for the iterator ceases to be satisfied.
Usage	Used when code size needs to be small, and time complexity is not an issue.	Used when time complexity needs to be balanced against an expanded code size.
Code Size	Smaller code size	Larger Code Size.
Time Complexity	Very high(generally exponential) time complexity.	Relatively lower time complexity(generally polynomial-logarithmic).

tree definition
https://www.gatevidyalay.com/tree-data-structure-tree-terminology/


Tree needs to be fully connected (n-1 edges), and doesn't include cycles

Revisit

Inorder v.s. preorder

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/
very similar to pre-order
